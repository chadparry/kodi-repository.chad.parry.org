# Chad Parry's Kodi Repository

## Kodi Tools

The easiest way to create a conforming Kodi repository is with the [`create_repository.py`](tools/create_repository.py) tool.
It is documented on the official Kodi Wiki at https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_repositories#Repository_Tools.

## Kodi Add-ons

This Kodi repository contains useful add-ons, including Remote Control Browser, which enables browsing websites with a remote control.
An installable repository package is available for download at https://chad.parry.org/software/kodi/.
